"""fs analizer'view

This package contains the UI-related logic of the fs_analyzer app.

    
In particular,

Modules:
* cli_view.py: containing the implementation of a basic command line UI accessing the features
    of the fs_analyzer app.
* view.py: containing the definition of the class representing the abstraction of view for the 
    fs_analyzer app, which is general enough to accomodate for any other UI, both command line
    or graphical ones, possibly to be implemented in the future. 

The package depends on the typer module.
